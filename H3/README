H3

Problem 1:
The first step was writing the code to print the request header and content to the
console. After I did this, I was able to examine the header of a web request I created
to find the http version used by the browser. After examinination of output_part1.txt
I determined that the version was HTTP/1.1 .
To run:
in H3 folder run make:
make 


Problem 2:
I extended tiny to respond with a video file if the request uri is 
/cgi-bin/centaur_serv.cgi . The web page will prompt to accept a download of
centaur_serv.cgi, this is actually the mpg video file and when you change the 
filetype to .mpg you can watch the video. Also, after the file download starts the 
server shuts down. I was unable to determine the cause.

To use:
# Make tiny.c
make

#Make centaur_serv.cgi, this is the file that contains the video serving logic
cd /cgi-bin/
make

Problem 3:
In this problem I modified the static server code to use malloc and rio_read 
instead of Mmap. The changes can be seen between lines 159 to 173.
