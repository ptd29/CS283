Problem 10.6

Assuming block addresses start at 0x00 byte address

request     Block Size (decimal bytes)          Block header (hex)
malloc(1)   8 Bytes ((1+4) bytes rounded up)    0x09    (8 + 1)
malloc(5)   16 Bytes (5+4 bytes rounded up)     0x11    (16 + 1)
malloc(12)  16 Bytes (12+4 bytes)               0x11    (16 + 1)    
malloc(13)  24 Bytes (13+4 bytes rounded up)    0x19    (24 + 1)

Each byte allocated by malloc also has a 4 byte header, hence malloc(1) is
actually 1 byte + 4 byte header = 5 bytes which is then rounded to 8 bytes
as per the problem instructions.
The block header is the block size + 1 byte.
