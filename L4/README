Program description: This assignment consisted of two programs, an http client and an http
server.

The http client makes a web request to the ip address at the given port number
for the requested page name. The program then displays the contents of the response to the
console and terminates.

The http server takes in a port number as the command line argument. A socket is then
openned to listen for incoming requests. When a request is received, a connection is
then made with the client. The program then reads the request and attempts to find the
requested file and if it is found the server creates a response header and sends the
requested document contents back to the client.

Sample outputs for the client and server runs can be found in
client_output.txt and server_output.txt.
