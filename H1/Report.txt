To Clean:
make clean

This assignment consists of three programs:

Problem 1: This program takes in a command line argument with the file to
be read in. By default if no arguments are given the application will
attempt to open test.txt for reading.

Once opening the file, the contents are read into a stack object I defined
using the push function I wrote. After all lines are read into the stack
each line of text is popped out of the stack and printed thus printing the
contents in reverse oreder.

Problem 2: This program reads in an integer from the command line and 
prints out the binary representation of the integer value. The argument
must be between an integer in the range of 0 and 4294967295.

The program works by taking in the command line argument and converting
it to an unsigned integer which has the ability of holding the values
specified above. The entered value is then evaluated for all powers of
2 between 0 and 31. When the entered value is greater then the power of
2 then it is decremented and a 1 is printed to the console, otherwise a 
zero is printed.

Problem 3: This program calculates the size of an unsigned long variable
in c without using any system commands.

To acheive this, I created a long integer array of length 2. Then
I created a pointer to the first value of the array and stored its address.
I then incremented the pointer, thus making it point to the next element in
the array, and stored the new address. Finally I found the difference
between the two addresses which was the size of a long int.
