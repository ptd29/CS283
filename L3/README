To build:
    make all
To run:
    make run
To run tests:
    First:
        make prep_test
        /* Places test files in directories a and b /*
    Second:
        make run
        /* Runs tests */

Program Description:
This program takes in two arguments that are the paths to two directories. These two
directories then have their files compared. If a file exists in directory a but not in
directory b then the file is copied to folder b. On the other hand, if a file exists in 
directory b but not in directory a, then that file is deleted. Finally, if a file exists
in both directories, then the most up to date file (by last modified timestamp) replaces
the older file.

Other notes:
File permissions are maintained when missing files in b are created
