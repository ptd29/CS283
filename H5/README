All programs compile with the make file:
command: make

P1:
    program found in hello.c
    To compile: make
    To run: ./hello <number_of_threads>

P2: Csapp 12.17:

To run: ./buggy

A: The reason the buggy program does not print the hello world statement is that the
child thread is put to sleep right away. This gives the parent thread time to complete
execution and terminate, thus not allowing the child thread to print.

B: This can be fixed by joining the child thread with the parent thread so that the 
parent thread waits for the child thread to continue before exiting. This can also be fixed
by calling pthread_exit() instead of exit(0).

P3:
    I created a argument structure to hold the task id, sum, and string message that each
thread needs to print. These parameters were initialized and then passed in to the
HelloCreate function during the pthread create loop.

To Run: ./hello-hw

P4:
    I updated the code so each thread sums up a portion of the two vectors. When the partial
sums are done being calculated, the threads are joined and the partial sums are summed
to get the final result.

To Run: ./dotpr-hw
