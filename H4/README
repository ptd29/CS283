To build:
    make all

To run:
    ./file_replace <search_string> <replacement_string> <prepend_string>

This progam searches all files in the directory testdir using the three input strings
that are passed in as command line arguments. While searching the files, the program
searchs for the search_string parameter within the file. If this string is found it is
replaced with the replacement_string. However, if the string is not found, it will be
prepended to any occurrences of the third arguemtn, prepend_string.


Program Design:
The way I went about writing this program was to first search and replace any instances
of the search string. I did this by creating a temporary file which I would write to
and replace all occurences of the string. If no occurences were found, this file would then
be re-oppened and all occurences of the prepend_string will be read from the temporary file
and the original file will be truncated and written with the updated text in a similar
fashion to the writes to the temporary file. On the other hand, if the search_string was
found in the original file, the contents of the temporary file are just coppied back
to the original file.
